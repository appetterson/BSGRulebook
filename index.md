# BSG - The unified rulebook

This page is a fork of the original created by jbiatek on github. View the original page [here](https://jbiatek.github.io/BSGRulebook/).

This rulebook is intended to be a single source for looking up rules for Battlestar Galactica, unifying the various sources of information in a single place. It's also intended to be as detailed and precise as possible.

This fork was set up to attempt to deploy the page as a pwa, and may include some of my personal house rules.
